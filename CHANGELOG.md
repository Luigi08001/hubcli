# Changelog

## 0.5.4 - 2026-04-21

**GitHub repo transferred to `revfleet` organization.** All URLs
(`github.com/Luigi08001/hscli/*`) now redirect to
`github.com/revfleet/hscli/*`. The `@revfleet/hscli` npm package and
the `revfleet` GitHub org are now fully aligned under the same brand.

### Fixed

- `hscli --help` now correctly shows `Usage: hscli [options] [command]`
  (was showing `Usage: hubcli ...` cosmetically — the program.name()
  was left at "hubcli" during the 0.5.2 rename).
- CLI program description updated from "HubSpot CLI" to "Headless
  HubSpot CLI + MCP server" for consistency with the tagline.

### Updated

- `package.json`: homepage, bugs.url, repository.url → revfleet/hscli
- README + CHANGELOG + CONTRIBUTING + docs/TIERS.md: all github.com
  URLs point at the new canonical location.

### No behavior change

162 tests pass, 0 vulns. Old `github.com/Luigi08001/hscli` URLs
automatically 301-redirect (GitHub handles this indefinitely).

---

## 0.5.3 - 2026-04-21

**npm package scoped to `@revfleet/hscli`.** After npm's anti-typosquat
rule rejected both `hubcli` (too similar to `hub-cli`, an unrelated
ArcGIS CLI) and `hscli` (too similar to `hs-cli`, another generic
package), we moved the package to the authors organization on npm. This
is the same pattern HubSpot itself uses for their own packages
(`@hubspot/cli`, `@hubspot/api-client`).

### Install

```bash
npm install -g @revfleet/hscli
```

Binary + everything else is unchanged: `hscli crm contacts list`.

### Why @revfleet/

`revfleet` is the authors product organization for CRM + HubSpot
operational tooling. Future siblings (`@revfleet/orchestrator`,
`@revfleet/audit`, etc.) will live under the same scope, so the
authorship and maintenance signal stays coherent across the toolchain.

### Zero behavior change

- 162 tests still pass
- 0 npm audit vulnerabilities
- 100% HubSpot API coverage
- Same binary name (`hscli`)
- Same config dir (`~/.hscli/`)
- Same env vars (`HSCLI_*`)

---

## 0.5.2 - 2026-04-21

**Rename: `hubcli` → `hscli`.** npm's anti-typosquat rule rejected
the `hubcli` name because it's "too similar to hub-cli" (an unrelated
ArcGIS Portal CLI). Rather than fight the heuristic with an appeal,
we renamed cleanly.

### What changes

- **npm package**: `hubcli` → `hscli`. Install: `npm install -g hscli`.
- **Binary**: `hubcli` → `hscli`. Daily use: `hscli crm contacts list`.
- **Config directory**: `~/.hubcli/` → `~/.hscli/`. Existing users migrate
  by running `mv ~/.hubcli ~/.hscli`.
- **Env vars**: `HUBCLI_*` → `HSCLI_*` (HSCLI_PROFILE, HSCLI_HOME,
  HSCLI_MCP_PROFILE, HSCLI_TELEMETRY_FILE, HSCLI_VAULT_PASSPHRASE,
  HSCLI_STRICT_CAPABILITIES, HSCLI_MCP_STRICT_CAPABILITIES,
  HSCLI_MCP_TOOL_NAME, HSCLI_REQUEST_ID, HSCLI_TRACE_BODIES,
  HSCLI_DEV_APP_ID, HSCLI_ENDPOINTS_JSON, HSCLI_PLUGINS,
  HSCLI_ENABLE_SANDBOX_CONTRACT, HSCLI_SANDBOX_TOKEN).

### Build hygiene

- Added `rm -rf dist` to the build script so tarballs ship clean
  (previous 0.5.1 tarball would have included stale `dist/commands/
  seed.js` alongside the new `dist/commands/seed/` modules).

### No behavior change

All 162 tests still pass. 100% API coverage preserved. Same commands,
same flags, same MCP tools — just renamed.

---

# Changelog

## 0.5.0 - 2026-04-21

**100% HubSpot public API coverage.** Every one of the 1,180 endpoints in
HubSpot's dev-docs surface now has a dedicated hubcli subcommand or an
alternate-path variant. Cross-reference against the scrape at
`~/Desktop/vault/HubSpot Audit/api-mapping/endpoints.json` (1,180
endpoints across 70 path roots) shows 1180 / 1180 covered.

Positioning: hubcli is now the **headless HubSpot** with full portal
coverage — every portal operation that can be done through HubSpot's UI
can be done through hubcli, with no UI dependency (enterprise safety
rails: policy-guarded writes, idempotency keys, rate-limit aware,
read-only profiles, JSON/CSV/YAML output).

### Added — 8 first-class CRM objects

`crm leads`, `crm carts`, `crm orders`, `crm discounts`, `crm fees`,
`crm taxes`, `crm communications`, `crm users` — each with the full
`registerObjectCommands` surface: list, get, search, filter, count,
create, update, delete, batch-read, batch-upsert, batch-archive.

### Added — CMS deep coverage

- Full content-op lifecycle on every CMS content type (`site-pages`,
  `pages`, `landing-pages`, `landing-page-folders`, `blog-posts`,
  `blogs`, `blog-authors`, `blog-tags`, `redirects`) via a generic
  `registerCmsContentCommands` helper: CRUD + batch (read/create/update/
  archive) + `clone` + `schedule` + `draft {get,update,push-live,reset}`
  + `revisions {list,get,restore,restore-to-draft}` + `ab-test
  {create-variation,end,rerun}` + `multi-language {attach,create-
  variation,detach,set-primary,update-languages}`.
- `cms blog-settings {get,update,revisions}` + `multi-language` subcmds.
- `cms source-code {get,create,update,delete,metadata,validate,extract,
  extract-status}` — theme/module source code CRUD via public API.
- `cms domains`, `cms audit-logs`, `cms seo-audit`, `cms search`,
  `cms topics`.

### Added — New top-level domains

- `media-bridge` — full video/media partner API: properties CRUD +
  batch, property groups, schemas + associations, settings (register,
  event-visibility, object-definitions, oembed-domains), playback
  events (attention-span, media-played, media-played-percent).
- `feature-flags` — app-dev feature flag framework CRUD.
- `extensions calling|videoconferencing|accounting` + raw escape hatch
  for future `/crm/v3/extensions/*` APIs.
- `integrators timeline-event-templates` + `tokens` — app-dev timeline
  event templates with token subresources.

  on old content): CRUD + clone + publish/unpublish + stats.
- `owners-extras` — archived owners listing.
- `business-units` — root `/business-units/v3` path.
- `form-integrations` — file upload signed URL redirect.

  by-utk, create-or-update, update-by-id, delete, recent, search,
  lists, list-contacts).

  template-by-id, template-buffer, template-versions, layouts,
  layout-by-id, layout-buffer, layout-buffered-changes, layout-versions,
  modules, module-by-id, module-by-path, url-mappings, domains,
  domain-by-id, indexed-properties). Each is a flexible subcommand with
  optional `--method` and `--data`.

## 0.4.0 - 2026-04-21

Completeness and coverage release. Brings hubcli to ~100% of the stable
HubSpot public API surface: fixes three orphan top-level modules that were
shipped but never wired into the CLI in 0.3.0, adds high-leverage search
primitives to every CRM object, closes seven documented P1 coverage gaps
(files folders, marketing events attendance, associations v4 labels, legacy
email events per-recipient stream, conversations inboxes/channels/channel-
accounts/actors, CRM UI Extension cards, sales sequences enroll/unenroll),
and reaches a fully clean `npm audit` (0 vulnerabilities) with no
runtime-facing advisories.

### Added

- `crm <object> filter` — search across any CRM object with property filters
  and HubSpot standard operators (EQ, NEQ, GT, GTE, LT, LTE, HAS_PROPERTY,
  NOT_HAS_PROPERTY, CONTAINS_TOKEN, NOT_CONTAINS_TOKEN, BETWEEN). Supports
  `--sorts`, `--properties`, `--query`, `--limit`, `--after`, `--count-only`.
  Applies to contacts, companies, deals, tickets, products, quotes, line-items,
  invoices, subscriptions, payments, goals, and every custom object registered
  via `registerObjectCommands`.
- `crm <object> count` — count-only mode for fast totals, optionally filtered.
- `files folders {list,get,create,update,archive}` — File Manager folder CRUD
  (`/files/v3/folders`), including `--parent-folder-id` filtering for tree walks.
- `marketing events participations <externalEventId>` — breakdown of
  participation state by attendee
  (`/marketing/v3/marketing-events/{id}/participations/breakdown`).
- `marketing events attendance <externalEventId> <state>` — record attendance
  state transitions (register | cancel | attend | no-show) for contacts on an
  event (`/marketing/v3/marketing-events/attendance/{id}/{state}/create`).
- `crm associations labels {list,create,update,delete}` — CRUD user-defined
  association label definitions between two object types
  (`/crm/v4/associations/{fromType}/{toType}/labels`).
- `email-events {list,get,campaigns-by-id,campaign}` — legacy per-recipient
  event stream with filters for recipient, campaign id, event type, timestamps
  (`/email/public/v1/events`, `/email/public/v1/campaigns/*`). Richer than
  `marketing emails stats` for downstream analytics pipelines.
- `conversations inboxes {list,get}`, `conversations channels {list,get}`,
  `conversations channel-accounts {list,get}`, `conversations actors {get,batch-read}` —
  routing topology and actor hydration endpoints
  (`/conversations/v3/conversations/{inboxes,channels,channel-accounts,actors}`).
- `crm cards {list,get,create,update,delete}` — UI Extension card definitions
  for app developers building CRM record sidebar cards
  (`/crm/v3/extensions/cards/{appId}`).
- `sales sequences enroll` — enroll a contact in a sales sequence
  (`POST /automation/v4/sequences/enrollments`).
- `sales sequences unenroll <enrollmentId>` — cancel an active enrollment
  (`POST /automation/v4/sequences/enrollments/{id}/cancel`).

### Fixed

- **Wire three orphan top-level modules** that existed in `src/commands/` but
  were never called from `src/cli.ts` in 0.3.0, making 18 subcommands invisible
  at runtime:
  - `hubcli account` — info, audit-logs, private-apps, api-usage
  - `hubcli communication-preferences` — definitions, status, subscribe,
    unsubscribe, email-resubscribe
  - `hubcli events` — event-definitions CRUD + send behavioral events
- **Clean npm audit** (0 vulnerabilities, including devDependencies):
  - Removed `@hubspot/cli` from `devDependencies` — it was never imported by
    source or tests, contributed 14 transitive advisories (axios, express,
    vite, js-yaml, minimatch, qs, etc.), and its presence did not support
    `hubcli doctor hublet-check` (that feature reads `~/.hscli/config.yml`
    which is only written by a *global* install of `@hubspot/cli`).
    Contributors who want to test `doctor hublet-check` should install
    `@hubspot/cli` globally: `npm i -g @hubspot/cli`.
  - Bumped `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` from ^1.27.1 to ^1.29.0 (patches
    ReDoS CVE GHSA-8r9q-7v3j-jr4g and cross-client leak GHSA-345p-7cg4-v4c7).
  - Added `overrides.path-to-regexp: ^8.4.2` to force the patched transitive
    through express@5.2.1 → router@2.2.0 (fixes GHSA-j3q9-mxjg-w52f and
    GHSA-27v5-c462-wpq7 ReDoS).

### Known niche gaps (deferred, not P1)

The following HubSpot API surfaces remain intentionally unshipped — each is
either out of scope for a general-purpose CRM CLI or depends on internal/
unstable endpoints:

- CMS source code / project upload / theme push (belongs to `@hubspot/cli`)
- Developer Projects API (`/project-components-external/v3`)
- Design Manager file push
- Playbooks / Documents tracking (no stable public API)
- Marketing SMS (limited GA availability)
- CTA legacy API (`/cta/v3`)
- Accounting Extension (`/crm/v3/extensions/accounting`) — QBO/Xero niche
- Video Conferencing Extension (`/crm/v3/extensions/videoconferencing`)
- Partner API (`/partners/v3`) — Solutions Partners only

---

## 0.3.0 - 2026-04-17

First public release. hubcli now covers ~95% of HubSpot's public API surface across 25 command domains, with a ~125-tool MCP server and enterprise safety rails throughout.

### Command domains added since 0.2.0

**CRM (now 22 files in `src/commands/crm/`):**
- `crm quotes`, `crm products`, `crm line-items` — commerce-adjacent objects
- `crm payments`, `crm invoices`, `crm subscriptions` — full commerce hub
- `crm goals` — goal tracking
- `crm pipelines` — now full CRUD (stages create/update/delete), previously read-only
- `crm properties` — full CRUD including delete, plus property groups list/create/update

**Marketing (9 files in `src/commands/marketing/`):**
- `marketing ads` — ad accounts + campaigns
- `marketing social` — social accounts + publishing
- `marketing seo` — SEO recommendations + topics
- `marketing landing-pages` — landing page management
- `marketing subscriptions` — email subscription types
- `marketing events` — marketing events
- `marketing behavioral-events` — custom behavioral event tracking
- `marketing transactional` — transactional email + SMTP tokens
- `marketing emails stats <emailId>` — per-email engagement metrics (opens, clicks, bounces, unsubscribes)

**Sales (4 files):**
- `sales sequences` — sales sequences (list/get/enrollments, auto-detected userId)
- `sales meetings` — meetings API
- `sales calling` — call engagements
- `sales goals` — sales goal tracking

**Service (4 files):**
- `service chatflows` — chatflow configuration

- (existing: conversations, feedback, tickets in `crm`)

**New top-level domains:**
- `account` — info, audit-logs, private-apps, api-usage
- `automation` — workflow automation
- `communication-preferences` — subscription / GDPR preference management
- `conversations` — inbox conversations
- `events` — event-based API surface
- `exports` — CRM export jobs (create, list, get, status)
- `lists` — modern CRM v3 Lists API (list, get, create, update, delete, add-members, remove-members, search)
- `reporting` — analytics dashboards and reports
- `settings` — users, teams, business-units, currencies, GDPR, audit-logs
- `site-search` — indexed site search with type param
- `timeline` — timeline events

### MCP server

- `src/mcp/server.ts` — expanded to ~125 tools covering the full surface
- 19 net-new tools since 0.2.0: lists, sequences, reporting, exports, pipeline stages, property groups, plus CRM lifecycle and custom object tools
- Profile isolation via `HUBCLI_MCP_PROFILE` env var
- All tool responses redacted for secrets

### Security

- **LICENSE file added** (MIT — previously declared only in package.json)
- **Encrypted vault support** (`src/core/vault.ts`) — optional encrypted `auth.enc` storage with passphrase, plus full encrypt / decrypt / rotation lifecycle
- **Permissions module** (`src/core/permissions.ts`) — scope-aware permission checks
- Expanded secret redaction across all output paths
- Path scope enforcement tightened in transport
- `npm audit fix` pass: baseline vulnerability sweep
- **Known dependency issues** (not blocking ship, documented for transparency):
  - 1 high-severity runtime transitive (`path-to-regexp 8.3.0` via `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`) — pending upstream fix in MCP SDK. Does not affect hubcli's own code paths (no user input routed through affected API surface).
  - ~14 dev-only transitive vulns via `@hubspot/cli` devDependency (used for CMS workflows in development). These do not ship in the published package.

### Dev experience

- **ESLint + typescript-eslint** — migrated from biome, now `npm run lint` + `npm run lint:fix`
- **`@hubspot/cli`** added as a dev dependency for CMS workflows
- `CLAUDE.md` — AI agent guidance for working in the repo
- `CHANGELOG-OPENCLAW.md` — internal release tracker for the multi-repo project

  - `tests/plugins.test.ts` — plugin architecture
  - `tests/schemas.test.ts` — schema cache behavior
  - `tests/vault.test.ts` — encrypted vault lifecycle (encrypt, decrypt, rotate)
  - (plus existing cli, mcp, contract.sandbox, http)
- **155 tests passing** (10 sandbox tests skipped by default; enable with `HUBCLI_ENABLE_SANDBOX_CONTRACT=1`)

### Documentation
